# No external Python packages required for basic LaTeX rendering
# The script uses only standard library modules:
# - subprocess
# - os
# - sys
# - shutil
# - pathlib

# However, you need a LaTeX distribution installed on your system:
# - MiKTeX (Windows): https://miktex.org/
# - TeX Live (Linux/Mac): https://www.tug.org/texlive/
# - Or use online services like Overleaf: https://www.overleaf.com/
